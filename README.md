# Usage
unpack the zip file, and "perl ***.pl".

#<1>#Usage of rbp.pl - predict which RBP causes the biogenesis of circRNA

###Usage: perl rbp.pl [options]

 required:
 
  -a	the left intron sequence of circRNA (fasta format).
  
  -b	the right intron sequence of circRNA (fasta format).
  
  -g	the species used (human/mouse drosophila or arabidopsis). ##human and mouse use the same motif file##
  
  -o	output file name.
  
 optional:
 
  -l	the length of flanking sequences of circRNA, which will be used to detect RBP motifs [default: input left/right intron length].


#<2># Usage of pre_db.pl - prepare files that would be used in reverse complemnt mechanism or lariat mechanism prediction

###Usage: perl pre_db.pl [options]

 required:
 
  -a	the left intron sequence of circRNA (fasta format).  #sequence name should be same as that in right intron sequence file; the length of sequence name should shorter than 20 characters, and without special characters such as "|", and should be started with letters.
  
  -b	the right intron sequence of circRNA (fasta format).  #sequence name should be same as that in left intron sequence file; the length of sequence name should shorter than 20 characters, and without special characters such as "|", and should be started with letters.
  
  -o	output database (prepare files) name.


#<3>#Usage of rc.pl - predict whether reverse complementary (rc) sequence causes the biogenesis of circRNA

#####ATTENTION: pre_db.pl should be ran before running rc.pl

###Usage: perl rc.pl [options]

 required:
 
  -p	the name of the database, which was created by pre_db.pl
  
  -o	output file name.
  
 optional:
 
  -e	entropy value [default = 0.1, the shorter value the more credible the result is].
  
  -n	gaps between complementary sequence [default = 0, the shorter gaps the more credible the result is].


#<4>#Usage of lariat.pl - predict whether lariat causes the biogenesis of circRNA

#####ATTENTION: pre_db.pl should be ran before running lariat.pl

###Usage: perl lariat.pl [options]

 required:
 
  -p	the name of the database, which was created by pre)db.pl
  
  -o	output file name.
  
 optional:
 
  -e	entropy value [default = 5, the larger value the more credible the result is].
  
  -n	gaps between complementary sequence [default = 2, the larger gaps the more credible the result is].
